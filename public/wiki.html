              style="text-decoration: none; color: #059bff">Computer Science</a> and minoring in Applied Statisticss. 
              He is a former Software Engineering Intern for Vitesco Technologies and current Software Development
              Intern at Qualtrics in Seattle, Washington. Cunningham attended the International Academy of Macomb, the eigth best high school in the United States at the time of graduating. 
              In 2019 Cunningham enrolled at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor to further his education. Following graduation in 2023, he intends to work as a Software Devloper with goals to become a manager.
              His ultimate goal in his career is to start a business in the software industry. He doesnâ€™t know what shape that aspiration will take, so he is trying to become knowledgeable in
              all aspects of development whether that be web development, <a

            confident that as his arsenal of tools in the table below grows, he will be ready to succeed.</p>

            <p>Here are the long-term projects he has worked on outside of school and internships.</p>

              <a href="portfolio.html#port" style="text-decoration: none;     color: #059bff;"><h3 style="margin-bottom: -20px;">Portofolio Website</h3></a>
              <h5 style="color: rgb(128,128,128)">(HTML, CSS, JS)</h1>
              <p>Following his first internship as a web developer, Cunningham decided to use what he leared to make his own website. After attending the career fair in his freshman year at the University of Michigan, Cunningham felt like he was going to get lost amongst all the other candidates. In an effort to stand out to recruiters, he made a website inspired by companies he desired to one day work for. The website is home to big projects he has worked on in his career, as well as provides insight on who he is as a developer and as a person. He regularly updates the website when he has new ideas or information to add.</p>

              <h5 style="color: rgb(128,128,128)">(HTML, CSS, JS, Python, MySQL)</h1>
              <p>In an effort to learn some new skills and maintain some old skills during the summer break, Cunningham spent time away from his internship with Vitesco Technologies working on a Stock Trading Python Bot with a colleague. The idea was to see if there is a link between news articles and the prices of the stocks of the subjects of the articles. The bot uses web scraping and sentiment analysis to decide whether the article was sharing positive or negative news about a particular company that the bot owned shares in and decide whether or not to buy more shares or sell off the ones it owns. Cunningham made a website to visualize the portfolio as well as how the bot made its decisions. Completing this project taught Cunningham alot about back-end development and machine learning.</p>

          <h4>High School</h4>
          <div class="words">
            <p>From a young age, Cunningham looked for ways to challenge himself academically. When he heard about the magnet
              school in his area that taught the rigourous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme"
                target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #059bff">IB Program</a>, the International Academy
              of Macomb, he knew that was the right place for him. While the program prepared him well for college, the
              most important takeaway from his high school experience was his development as a thinker. He was taught to
              think critically, not only looking at what happens in the world around him but also why and how those
              things happen. He knew that would be an integral tool in both his higher education and his career as an
              engineer.<br><br>
              High school is also where Cunningham decided to pursue Computer Science as a career. As part of the IB program, students were
              tasked with choosing a project with only one requirement: it must take one year to complete. Like most kids in Cunningham's
              generation, he grew up playing video games with his friends. He realized he had no idea what it was like to make a video game, so he chose
              that to be his project. He spend months learning the basics of game design and programming, with the goal of making a video game based around surviving the IB program.
              The game included his friends and everyone's favorite teachers as the bosses you had to defeat to graduate. When presenting his project at the expo at the end of the year,
              the overwhelmingly positive response to his poor drawing suprised Cunningham, and made him realize he could make a future out of that sort of thing. While he doesn't intend to
              work as a game developer in the future, it is the reason he is pursuing computer science today.</p>

          <h4>College</h4>
          <div class="words">
            <p>Continuing to pursue a challenging academic experience, he decided to attend the highly esteemed College
              of Engineering at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan" target="_blank"
                style="text-decoration: none; color: #059bff">University of Michigan</a>. For the first time he is
              surrounded by people who truly share his passion for learning as well as engineering. So far, his time at
              college has taught him to take a more conceptual approach to engineering and push his limits as a student.
              His professors and superiors care more about how much he's learning rather than what his report card looks
              like. While this was an uncomfortable adjustment at first, it is a welcome one. He has also developed as
              an adult, with more responsibilities than ever.<br><br>
            In his free time while in school, Cunningham tries to be an active member on campus. In his sophmore year, he join Michigan Hackers, a student organization that
            where teams work on semester long projects covering topics like interview preparation and machine learning. He also joins the Michigan Data Science Team to get more
          exposure to Data Science after the University suddenly ended the Computer Science and Data Science Dual Major he intended to pursue when he started college.</p>

          <h4>Career</h4>
          <div class="words">
            <p> Cunningham began his software engineering career as a research assistant at the University of Michigan in the Bioinformatics Lab.
              His responsibilities included writing scripts for his mentor to use as well as editing research papers his mentor was working on. This was
              actually Cunningham's first professional experience programming as he was taking his first computer science course at the same time. After his freshman year in 2020,
              he got a job as a web development intern with Acuitii, a medical tech start up based in Detroit. He contributed to the design of the company's first website launch
              as well as helped test the mobile app. In 2021, Cunningham held an eight month Software Engineering Internship with Vitesco Technologies, an electric vehicle parts supplier,
              in Auburn Hills, Michigan. His responsibilities included writing tests for the integration of hardware and software as well as writing scripts to speed up existing processes.
              In 2022, Cunningham will work as a Software Devlopment Intern with Qualtrics out of their Seattle office.
              <br><br>At this point in his life he doesn't know what his career will look like exactly. He does know that he is
              actively working to prepare himself for whatever that career turns out to be. In college, he's taught
              software developement. On his own, he teaches himself <a

              make himself a well-rounded engineer. He also intends to pursue Data Science and <a

              graduating well-versed in these fields will be an invaluable resource for him as an employee.
              No matter what shape his future takes, he knows that he will be ready.</p>
