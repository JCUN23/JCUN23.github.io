            <p>From a young age, he looked for ways to challenge himself academically. So when he heard about the magnet
              school in his area that uses the rigourous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme"
                target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #059bff">IB Program</a>, the International Academy
              of Macomb, he knew that was the right place for him. While the program prepared him well for college, the
              most important takeaway from his high school experience was his development as a thinker. He was taught to
              think critically, not only looking at what happens in the world around him but also why and how those
              things happen. He thinks this will be an integral tool in both his higher education and his career as an
              engineer.</p>

              of Engineering at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan" target="_blank"
                style="text-decoration: none; color: #059bff">University of Michigan</a>. For the first time he is
              surrounded by people who truly share his passion for learning as well as engineering. So far, his time at
              college has taught him to take a more conceptual approach to engineering and push his limits as a student.
              His professors and superiors care more about how much he's learning rather than what his report card looks
              like. While this was an uncomfortable adjustment at first, it is a welcome one. He has also developed as
              an adult, with more responsibilities than ever.</p>
